# Score Monster

Collect the scores of your hackerrank contests and store them in a google sheets.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to [@mjjunemann](https://github.com/mjjunemann), [@fvr1](https://github.com/fvr1), and [@gnmonsalve](https://github.com/gnmonsalve) for doing the previous versions of this script, previously known as `score-collector` .

## Installation

Requirements: Python 3.7+, [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/IIC1103/score-monster.git
cd score-monster

```

Install dependencies:

```sh
    pip install poetry
    poetry install
    poetry shell
```

## Basic Configuration

1. [Obtain OAuth2 credentials from Google Developers Console](https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2.html#using-signed-credentials). **Follow instructions of the site until Step 4.**

2. Rename the credentials to `credentials.json`

3. Create a spreadsheet in google sheets. Add a header to the spreadsheet.

4. Click the `Share` button and give edit access to the `client_email` located in your `credentials.json`

5. Optional: Add another tab named `Stats`

6. Create the `collect.json` file. This file contains all the information of contests and where to write them. More is explained below.

### The `collect.json` file

This file contains all the necessary information to collect the scores, and also where to write them. Here's an example

**`collect.json`**

```json
{
    "sheets": [
        {
            "sheetUrl": "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B9rofhwH6beR7ApC8aJbomaeJ0Dwkemm9bDrGfHGeg-gY/edit#gid=1835467540",
            "tabName": "Todos",
            "showStats": true,
            "contests": [
                {
                    "link": "iic1103-2019-2-lab1"
                },
                {
                    "link": "tarea-1-iic1103",
                    "startLimit": [2018, 12, 30, 20, 0],
                    "endLimit": [2019, 8, 26, 20, 0]
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "filter": ["hacker_1", "hacker_5", "hacker_17"]
}
```

#### Structure

The first key should always be `sheets` .

-   `sheets`

    A list of "sheet objects" where scores should be written. Inside each one you should specifiy the following items:

    -   `sheetUrl` : The url to the spreadsheet where the specified contest scores will be written.

    -   `tabName` : The name of the tab were scores will be written. Case sensitive. Based on the example above, the following picture shows two tabs on the spreadsheet: `Todos` which is the tab where scores will be written, and `Stats` which will be covered on the next item.

    ![tabs_example](assets/tabs.png)

    -   `showStats` (Optional): Indicates where stats (such as last updated) are shown in the `Stats` tab. So far, the only stat written is last updated, and it is always written on cell `A2` . An example of a `Stats` tab is shown below.

        ![stats_example](assets/stats.png)

    -   `contests` : An array of contests that will be written on this specific spreadsheet. Array contains "contest objects" as follows:

        -   `link` : The part of the hackerrank link that takes you to the contest. For example, if the complete link is www.hackerrank.com/iic1103-2019-2-lab1, then the link would be `iic1103-2019-2-lab1`

        -   `startLimit` (Optional): Sets a limit date from which scores will be considered. Any submission before that date is not considered. If this parameter is not given, any submission before `endLimit` is valid. The date should be passed as an array of 5 integers as follows: `[year, month, day, hour, minute]` .

        -   `endLimit` (Optional): Sets a top limit date which scores will be considered. Any submission after that date is not considered. If this parameter is not given, any submission after `startLimit` is valid. The date should be passed as an array of 5 integers as follows: `[year, month, day, hour, minute]` .

-   `filter` : An optional list of strings. Each string should represent a hacker's username. The script will collect only data from the specified hackers. Data from every hacker will be collected if this parameter is ommited or is left as an empty list.

## Usage

1. **Log in to Hackerrank either in firefox or chrome.** Really important! If you don't do this, the program will get stuck.
2. Simply run the two following lines:

```sh
poetry shell
poetry run python main.py
```

## Notes

-   Contests inside `collect.json` must contain either a `startTime` **and** an `endTime`, only a `startTime` or neither. The script won't work if only an `endTime` is given.

## Automatic weekly collection

This fork was made to add a script to automatically collect contests on a given date.
Requirements:

-   Mongo database (you can create one for free at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
-   Telegram Bot (https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot)
-   Telegram Chat ID (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32423837/telegram-bot-how-to-get-a-group-chat-id)
-   Spreadsheets already created for your contests, with the same name as contests.

and APScheduler to check for "to be collected" contests for that day. Then it uses the retrieved
information to update the `collect.json` file and finally executes the scraper and get the scores
printed at the selected spreadsheet. When all contests are collected, the script sends a Telegram notification.
For using this feature you have to do the following:

1. Create a DB Collection with the following structure:

```
{
    "collection": [
        {"id": 5e9919cede7c767b6fd7675c,
        "date": 2020-04-08T00:00:00.000+00:00,
        "contest_name":"laboratorio-1-2020-1",
        }
        // ...
    ]
}
```

2. Define the following environment variables with your information:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_URL
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
MONGO_URI
DB_NAME
COLLECTION_NAME
```

3. Upload to Heroku (or any server that runs 24/7, since this bot will run every day at 0:00 GMT-4 to
   check if there's a new contest to collect). This repository provides all you need to deploy to Heroku.
   **Quick tutorial to deploy to Heroku**
   a. Install Heroku CLI (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)
   b. Run `heroku create`.
   c. Set config vars (environment variables on Heroku) by running the following lines:

```
heroku config:set TELEGRAM_BOT_URL=value
heroku config:set TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=value
heroku config:set MONGO_URI=value
heroku config:set DB_NAME=value
heroku config:set COLLECTION_NAME=value
```
Replace "value" with your information.
d. Run `git checkout master`, `git add -f collect.json credentials.json`, and `git commit -m "add credentials"`. This is the only way for this to work on Heroku. An alternative and more secure way to do this would be to upload these files to a safe location and import them through an API (PRs welcome!).
**Make sure you don't push these files to a public repo on GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc**.
e. Run `git push heroku master`.
f. The script is ready.
